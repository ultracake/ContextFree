Simple instructions to build and run the calculator using the command line. We assume that ANTLR3 has been properly installed as explained in parsing.pdf.

The folder contains the file:
- Calculator.g: the ANTLR grammar for the calculator.

Instructions:

(1) Generate the parser with command

antlr3 Calculator.g

This will generate three files:
- CalculatorLexer.java
- CalculatorParser.java
- Calculator.tokens

(2) Compile the interpreter with command

javac *.java

(3) Run the interpreter with command

java Calculator

enter arithmetic expressions and see the result.
